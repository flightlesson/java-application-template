This is a template for starting a new Java application.

Customization starts by:

- Under src/main, rename "com/demo/myapp" to your package and MyApp.java to your main class.
- Edit and rename the "myapp" application wrapper script. Change TRUNK, jarfilebasename, and mainclass.
- Edit "pom.xml"; change <project><groupId>, <project><artifactId>, <properties><trunk> and ..<manifest><mainClass>.
- Edit "Makefile"; change default values for MYAPP and JARFILE.nnn
- Edit the renamed "MyApp.java" and add your application code.

To build the application using maven run "mvn package". 
Note that build artifacts get placed in "../maven-build-artifacts/myapp"
instead of "target", which is maven's default: this is to avoid polluting 
the project directory with build artifacts. See pom.xml to change this behavior.

To build the application using make, run "make all" or "make install". "make all"
simply runs 'mvn package'; "make install" creates the ../sandbox directory and
installs there. The sandbox can be useful in distributing your application.

Use the renamed "myapp" script to start the application. 
Try running with the "+h" command line arg, then with the "-h" command line arg.

Enjoy!
